                    <span class="fw-bold">Jimmy McGill was born on November 12, 1960, to Ruth and Charles McGill Sr in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.</span> 
                    He had one older brother, Charles "Chuck" McGill Jr. Jimmy later worked for his father at his small corner store 
                    and watched as he was repeatedly taken advantage of by scam artists. After one of the scam artists offered young 
                    Jimmy a life lesson about wolves and sheep, he began stealing money from his father's cash register mostly being 
                    rare coins. In his teenage years, Jimmy began to play his own scams to get quick money. In one of his most famous 
                    scams, he would find the most slippery patches of ice every winter, stage a fall, and earn himself a fair amount 
                    of money, which earned him the nickname "Slippin' Jimmy".

                </p>
                <p class="cv-info">
                    <span class="fw-bold">In the early 1990s</span>, Jimmy divorced his first wife when she cheated on him with a guy named Chet, who 
                    happened to owe Jimmy money. In 1992, a drunken Jimmy encountered Chet at a local Dairy Queen and decided to 
                    perform a "Chicago Sunroof" (defecating through the sunroof of Chet's car) as revenge. Unbeknownst to him, however,
                     Chet's children were in the back seat. Even worse, Chet had ties to the local prosecutors. Jimmy was quickly 
                     brought in by the police on charges of property damage, assault, and and a possible sex offense. He was booked
                      and put in pre-trial detention.

                    1993-2001
                </p>
                <p class="cv-info">
                    In Albuquerque, Jimmy befriended many people, including Chuck's then-wife Rebecca Bois and Chuck's law 
                        partner, Howard Hamlin. Most importantly, he met and began a semi-romantic relationship with Kim Wexler, 
                        a co-worker in the HHM mailroom who was attending law school. In 1993, Jimmy is delivering mail at HHM 
                        and talks to his co-workers about a betting pool for the Academy Awards he has organized. He crosses paths 
                        with Kim, who is also doing mail rounds. Chuck enters the office to a big round of applause, having just 
                        won a big inheritance lawsuit using his knowledge of obscure case law. When Chuck approaches the pair, 
                        he answers Kim's questions on case law, but is annoyed by Jimmy. After Howard collects Chuck, Kim continues 
                        her rounds, and Jimmy walks past HHM's law library. He turns around and steps inside, <span class="fw-bold">to become a 
                        lawyer like Chuck and Kim.</span>

                    <span class="fw-bold">In 2002,</span> Jimmy works hard at his own law practice but enjoys little success. He mostly works for the 
                    court as a public defender for $700 a case, struggles with debt, is forced to sleep in a cramped office located in 
                    the back of a Vietnamese nail salon. He also takes care of Chuck. While arriving at and departing from court, 
                    Jimmy frequently butts heads with Mike Ehrmantraut, a former Philadelphia police officer who was working as the 
                    courthouse parking lot attendant at the time. When Jimmy loses potential clients Craig and Betsy Kettleman - who 
                    have been accused of embezzling money from the county treasury - to HHM and fends off an attempted injury scam 
                    from Cal and Lars Lindholm, Jimmy decides to return to his shady techniques to level the playing field . He 
                    enlists the Lindholm brothers in an attempt to win back Craig and Betsy Kettleman.
